                <h6>Family</h6>
                <p>My family consists of both my parents and a younger brother. We enjoy exploring and having fun while doing so. We have taken trips throughout Texas; Mazatl√°n, MX; Chihuahua, MX; Key West, FL; Orlando, FL; Miami, FL; Taos, NM; Chicago, IL; Las Vegas, NV; Branson, MO</p>
                <p>My family is very tight and exciting. Our favorite thing to do is go out to eat and enjoy some hamburgers or steaks.</p>

                <h6>Chess</h6>
                <p>In this picture, I am challenging someone in a game of Chess in Chicago. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess. Chess has always fascinated me with the amount of patience and problem solving needed to win. The way that the pieces move, and the strategy needed to defend while attacking takes on many challenges. I love the thrill of challenges as it sets obstacles, and I have to find a way around it.</p>

                <h6>BPA</h6>
                <p>My favorite extracurricular activity is competing in Business Professionals of America. I compete in an even listed as Linux Operating System Fundamentals. I have competed in the state and national level. In this competition, I am also confronted with a challenge of creating a Linux server and setting it up the way the contest instructs me to do so. In these events I have won certifications in Java, Word, and Cisco IT. Apart from these certifications, the one that most prepared me for the Linux competition is the GIAC GFACT certifications. It is a Fundamentals of cybersecurity course and exam that taught me the basic of networking, cybersecurity, and Linux.

                <img src="JetSki.jpg" alt="">
                <h6>Outdoors</h6>
                <p>My family and I have always enjoyed exploring the outdoors. We have gone Jet Skiing around Key West, skiing down Angel Fire, walking around Branson, climbed and crawled through Enchanted Rock, and swam in many beaches around the southern shore of Texas. My favorite outdoor experience has been taking a jet ski tour around the island of Key West, Florida. We were to drive them fast, take pictures near landmarks, and even explore sand barges. I have also had unfortunate moments near the beaches around Galveston and Corpus Christi, where I have been stung by a jelly fish in 4 different occasions. Yet, these experiences have made them memories and something I can share with many.

                <h6>Friends</h6>
                <p>My friend group is very diverse. Some do soccer, some do basketball, and the rest focus on academics. One thing we all share though, is our love to have fun and enjoy each other's company. Even in our small town, we find ways to pass the time.
                    We love to play poker, play soccer at our local church, and talk while we eat some food. We have also traveled outside the city and went to play at Top Golf over the summer. We all enjoy the outdoors as well and plan to take trips later 
                    as a group to different states and hopefully to different countries.

                <h6>Cars</h6>
                <p>My favorite car is actually the one in this image, the McLaren Senna. I love cars and have attended car meets with my best friend and my family. The noise the exhaust makes when revving is like music to my ears. The engineering that goes into these hyper cars to reach extraordinary speeds is what makes cars more special. I am also in love with Formula 1 and have watched the movie many times. In the future, I plan to attend the F1 race in Austin, Miami, and Monaco.
